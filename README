A very basic Scheme implementation hosted on Lua, with basic Scheme to Lua
interoperability.

Although it does not do so yet, it may at some point conform to
the R*RS specifications.

Lazy overview:

Implemented:
 * Language primitves:
   - let, let*, if, define, lambda, quote, begin

 * Basic functions (cons, car, cdr, type testing, math operations, ...)

 * Lua interoperability
   - lua_var evaluates to "lua_var", translated to Scheme value
   - (lua_func ...) evaluates to the return value of lua_func(...) with the
       necessary type conversions.

Not implemented yet:
 * Language primitives:
   - letrec, and possiblity a few I don't know.

 * Error handling inside Scheme

 * Macros

 * Lua interoperability
   - Working with tables, methods, ...

May work:
 * Proper tail calls
